Summary:        YaST plugin for openwsman-server

%description
This package provides a YaST plugin for wsmand, the WS Management
Daemon. The plugin makes YaST (the ycp layer api) remotely accessible.
Combined with rwsman (the openwsman client bindings for Ruby) and Ruby
On Rails, one can e.g. easily create a Web interface for YaST.
